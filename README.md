# Webex Connect Android SDK Sample

This Android Sample App demonstrates how to integrate the [**WebexConnect Android SDK**](https://github.com/webex/webexconnect-android-sdk) to enable Push Notifications and In-App Messaging on Android devices. It serves as a practical reference for developers looking to implement these features quickly and effectively in their own applications.

## Getting Started

This demo app allows you to explore the integration of [webexconnect-android-sdk](https://github.com/webex/webexconnect-android-sdk) with minimal setup.

## Setup

You can run the app with your own `WebexConnect` app information and configuration settings.

### 1. Configure the SDK

You can either configure the file with your own `WebexConnect` app info:

- **Manually enter your values in the file:**
  - Open the file: `app/assets/IMIconnectConfig.properties`
  - Replace the value with your **appId**, **clientKey** that is generated by `WebexConnect` for your application and other configuration details

- **Download the [`IMIconnectConfig.properties`](https://developers.webexconnect.io/docs/android-modularization-sdk-quick-start-guide#c-add-imiconnectconfigproperties-file) file** and set it at the path: `app/assets/IMIconnectConfig.properties`

### 2. Set Up Firebase

If you're using Firebase:

- Replace the [`google-services.json`](https://developers.webexconnect.io/docs/set-up-firebase-cloud-messaging-project#integrate-firebase) file in the project with your own.
- Make sure the Firebase config matches your application package name and project settings.
